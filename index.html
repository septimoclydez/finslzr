		Sometimes I wish you knew But I disguise the truth I say I'm happy but I'm still stuck on us, mmm, mmm, mmm Does your mind play this game too? Think 'bout me and you I guess I'll just pretend Until it all makes sense, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm See you face
        to face, I'm thinking 'bout the days we used to be But I can't make a scene, but I can't make a scene See you face to face, I'm thinking 'bout the days we used to be But I can't make a scene, but I can't make it seem Like I want you You Even if
        it's true Even if it's true I guess it's overdue Tell me your point of view Tell me, am I to blame? You're so good with change, hmm, mmm, mmm A table set for two You got me waitin' but you ain't comin' through Try to stay patient but gotta face
        the truth, mmm, mmm, mmm Whoa, whoa See you face to face (see you face to face) I'm thinkin' 'bout the days we used to be (thinkin' 'bout the days) But I can't make a scene (no, I can't make a scene) But I can't make a scene (no, no, no, no) See
        you face to face (see you face) I'm thinking 'bout the days we used to be (oh, oh) But I can't make a scene (no, no, no, no, no, no) But I can't make it seem Like I want you You Even if it's true (even if it's true) (You, babe) Even if it's true
        There's no reason to believe I'll save us now But if you really love me, say it now Why is it so hard to figure out? I need you every day, believe me when I say it Like I want you You Even if it's true Even if it's trueSometimes I wish you knew
        But I disguise the truth I say I'm happy but I'm still stuck on us, mmm, mmm, mmm Does your mind play this game too? Think 'bout me and you I guess I'll just pretend Until it all makes sense, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm See you face to face, I'm thinking
        'bout the days we used to be But I can't make a scene, but I can't make a scene See you face to face, I'm thinking 'bout the days we used to be But I can't make a scene, but I can't make it seem Like I want you You Even if it's true Even if it's
        true I guess it's overdue Tell me your point of view Tell me, am I to blame? You're so good with change, hmm, mmm, mmm A table set for two You got me waitin' but you ain't comin' through Try to stay patient but gotta face the truth, mmm, mmm,
        mmm Whoa, whoa See you face to face (see you face to face) I'm thinkin' 'bout the days we used to be (thinkin' 'bout the days) But I can't make a scene (no, I can't make a scene) But I can't make a scene (no, no, no, no) See you face to face (see
        you face) I'm thinking 'bout the days we used to be (oh, oh) But I can't make a scene (no, no, no, no, no, no) But I can't make it seem Like I want you You Even if it's true (even if it's true) (You, babe) Even if it's true There's no reason to
        believe I'll save us now But if you really love me, say it now Why is it so hard to figure out? I need you every day, believe me when I say it Like I want you You Even if it's true Even if it's true. I don’t even know how to begin this without sounding like I’ve spent hours drafting it, but maybe that’s okay, because I have thought about this a lot. And it’s not about trying to say the right words, it’s about being real with you. So here it goes.

I just want to take a moment to appreciate you, not just for what you bring into my life, but for who you are. Your presence is like a calm in a storm, even if you don’t always see that in yourself. I see it. I feel it. And I’m grateful for it.

I know things between us are not exactly defined. We’re somewhere in between, and that’s okay. I don’t need a label to feel something real. I don’t need a title to appreciate you. I’m not here to push or pressure or make you feel like you have to give more than you’re ready to. That’s not love. That’s not care. And I care about you, deeply.

You’re still healing. You’re still figuring yourself out. And honestly, that’s a beautiful thing. The strength it takes to be honest about not being ready, that’s rare. Most people rush into things trying to fill a void. But you, you’re being thoughtful, careful, and real. And I respect that more than you know.

I don’t want you to feel guilty for not being ready. Emotions don’t work on schedules. Your heart needs time, space, and kindness. You’ve been through a lot, and you’re still standing. That alone makes you incredible.

If all we ever have is this undefined space filled with long talks, quiet laughs, deep stares, and shared moments of vulnerability, I’m okay with that. Because every moment with you, even the uncertain ones, feel honest. And that’s rare.

I’m not here to fix you. You’re not broken. You’re a whole person navigating your own story. I just want to be here if you want someone walking alongside you for a little while, or maybe longer. No pressure. No rush. Just presence.

And I want you to know that I admire how you carry yourself, even when you’re hurting. I admire how you still smile, even when you’re unsure. I admire how you open up, piece by piece, even when it scares you. I see all of it. And I appreciate it all.

You don’t owe me certainty. You don’t owe me promises. You don’t owe me forever. All I hope is that when you think of me, it feels safe. That being around me doesn’t add weight but eases it. That our moments don’t feel like a burden but a breath of fresh air.

This isn't me waiting for you. This is me being here with you, in whatever way feels right. It’s not about the destination, it’s about the now. And right now, you’re enough. As you are. Confused, healing, unsure. Still, enough.

[Verse 1]
It's so silly of me to act like I don't need you bad
When all, all I can think about is us since I seen you last
I know I didn't have to walk away
All I had to do was ask for space
I'm telling you, be on your way
When I told you to fall back

[Chorus]
So can you come pick up your clothes?
I have them folded
Meet me at the door while it's still open
I know it's getting cold out, but it's not frozen
So come pick up your clothes
I have them folded

[Post-Chorus]
I'll let your body decide if this is good enough for you
Already folding it for you
Already folding up for you
I'll let your body decide if this is good enough for you
Already folding it for you
Already folding up for you

[Verse 2]
No matter what you do to switch the story up, I know I made my mark
And I would still choose you through it all, that's the crazy part (Crazy part)
I don't need no morе empty promises, promise mе that you got it
I don't need roses, just need some flowers from my garden
Can't you go back to how you loved on me when you started?
I'll be here begging for ya, you should be giving me love
All damn day 'til the day is done (Done)
So if you wanna go that way, I'll be waiting on
